Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.?-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.?-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.?-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense."

-Daily Moisturizer: Apply a few drops to palm of hands and gently press onto face and neck. For best results- use morning and evening.
-Tip: Apply after Unicorn Essence skin enhancing antioxidant serum.

Hydrating Lips:
-It can be used to hydrate lips before applying lipstick. The Rose Gold Elixir effectively keep lips from drying out- especially when using liquid/matte lipsticks- without affecting the finish. -Be sure to let the drops absorb into the lips before applying lipstick.

Mix with your foundation:
-Use one to three drops to mix with your favorite foundation to keep your skin hydrated and glowing. Recommended: use a full coverage matte foundation.
-If product dries- out- just add one to three drops to your favorite cream concealer- contour- highlight- or brow pomade- to bring them back to life.

Application with a beauty sponge or brush:
-Start by dotting your foundation onto your skin first. Then apply one to two drops on a damp beauty sponge (or brush) to blend in your foundation for a glowing finish.
For those with dry under eyes (or requiring extra hydration):
-First apply concealer under eyes- followed by cream contour.
-Then apply two drops of Rose Gold Elixir to a damp beauty sponge (or brush) and blend in. (This makes blending easier and the 24k Gold helps achieve that radiant glow).

 Precautions:
-Store at room temperature.
-Discontinue use if redness or irritation occurs.
-Keep out of eyes.
-For external use only.

If left on the surface of the skin- like a mask- it will not absorb fully and the ingredients will not be effective.
-Thoroughly massage a small amount in an even layer to clean- dry skin until the color is fully absorbed.
-If used in combination with other products- apply Moon Fruit after cleansing and toning/misting but before other moisturizers.
-Follow with one of Herbivore?s facial oils for extra hydration and to lock in moisture. -Moon Fruit was formulated to work especially well with our facial oils. Herbivore suggests pairing them together for superior results.

-Please note that directly after application skin may feel tight- but will soften within a few hours as exfoliation takes place and the product absorbs deeply into the skin. -Allow plenty of time for this product to do its job- preferably overnight.
-Since Moon Fruit is not a mask you do not need to wash it off in the morning.
 Precautions:-For daytime use- avoid direct sunlight and use an SPF to protect skin from increased photosensitivity caused by the natural enzymes and AHA?s present in Moon Fruit.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.?-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.?-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.?-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense."

        "how_to_use":"Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.?-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.?-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.?-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense."
